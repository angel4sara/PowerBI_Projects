# Healthcare Analytics Power BI Project

## Overview
The **Healthcare Analytics** project is part of the Power BI Projects Repository. This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to provide actionable insights into patient demographics, satisfaction, wait times, and admission patterns. The dashboard leverages Power BI's interactive features, advanced DAX calculations, and integrated SQL for data transformation.

## Features

### Dashboards
- **Patient Demographics:**
  - Breakdown of patients by age groups (e.g., children, adults, teenagers, toddlers, and infants).
  - Ethnicity distribution across various age ranges.

- **Admission and Referral Analysis:**
  - Admission rates: 50.65% admitted, 49.35% not admitted.
  - Referrals: General practice, orthopedics, cardiology, and more.
  - Walk-in patients vs. referred patients (75.71% referred).

- **Satisfaction and Wait Time Insights:**
  - Average satisfaction score: 5.45
  - Average wait time: 35.53 minutes
  - Highlights satisfaction levels across ethnicities and age groups.

- **Visit Patterns:**
  - Total patient visits segmented by month and year (2019: 2,177; 2020: 2,455).
  - Analysis of weekday vs. weekend visits.

### Visualizations
- **Interactive Visuals:**
  - Heatmaps for ethnicity-based satisfaction scores.
  - Line charts and bar graphs showing patient visits over time.
  - Slicers to filter data by age, gender, and referral types.

### Datasets
- **Excel-based Data Sources:**
  - Patient data including age, ethnicity, referral type, and visit times.
  - Admissions and satisfaction records.

- **SQL Integration:**
  - Preprocessed data using SQL for enhanced query performance and data integrity.

## Key Metrics
- **Gender Breakdown:**
  - Patient visits segmented by gender.

- **Ethnicity-based Satisfaction:**
  - Highlights variation in satisfaction levels across ethnic groups.

- **Referral and Admission Insights:**
  - Admission rates for various specialties (e.g., cardiology, neurology).
